- Colorectal cancer is the third most diagnosed cancer, behind only breast and lung cancer. In terms of overall mortality, it ranks second due to, among other factors, problems with screening programs, which means that one of the factors that directly impacts survival and treatment success is early detection of the disease. Clusterin (CLU) is a molecular chaperone that has been linked to tumorigenesis, cancer progression and resistance to anticancer treatments, which has made it a promising drug target. However, it is still necessary to continue this line of research and to adjust the situations in which its use is more favorable. The aim of this paper is to review the current genetic knowledge on the role of CLU in tumorigenesis and cancer progression in general, and discuss its possible use as a therapeutic target in colorectal cancer.
