- Colorectal cancer is the third most diagnosed cancer, behind only breast and lung cancer. In terms of overall mortality, it ranks second due to, among other factors, problems with screening programs, which means that one of the factors that directly impacts survival and treatment success is early detection of the disease. Clusterin (CLU) is a molecular chaperone that has been linked to tumorigenesis, cancer progression and resistance to anticancer treatments, which has made it a promising drug target. However, it is still necessary to continue this line of research and to adjust the situations in which its use is more favorable. The aim of this paper is to review the current genetic knowledge on the role of CLU in tumorigenesis and cancer progression in general, and discuss its possible use as a therapeutic target in colorectal cancer.

## The Genomic Landscape of Colorectal Cancer in the Saudi Arabian Population Using a Comprehensive Genomic Panel
## （使用综合基因组面板的沙特阿拉伯人群中结直肠癌的基因组景观）

- Purpose: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology detects specific mutations that can provide treatment opportunities for colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. Patients and Methods: We analyzed the mutation frequencies of common actionable genes and their association with clinicopathological characteristics and oncologic outcomes using targeted NGS in 107 Saudi Arabian patients without a family history of CRC. Results: Approximately 98% of patients had genetic alterations. Frequent mutations were observed in BRCA2 (79%), CHEK1 (78%), ATM (76%), PMS2 (76%), ATR (74%), and MYCL (73%). The APC gene was not included in the panel. Statistical analysis using the Cox proportional hazards model revealed an unusual positive association between poorly differentiated tumors and survival rates (p = 0.025). Although no significant univariate associations between specific mutations or overall mutation rate and overall survival were found, our preliminary analysis of the molecular markers for CRC in a predominantly Arab population can provide insights into the molecular pathways that play a significant role in the underlying disease progression. Conclusions: These results may help optimize personalized therapy when drugs specific to a patient’s mutation profile have already been developed.
- （目的：下一代测序（NGS）技术检测可以为结直肠癌（CRC）患者提供治疗机会的特定突变。患者和方法：我们在107名没有CRC家族史的沙特阿拉伯患者中使用靶向NGS分析了常见可操作基因的突变频率及其与临床病理特征和肿瘤学结果的关联。结果：大约98%的患者有遗传改变。在BRCA2（79%），CHEK1（78%），ATM（76%），PMS2（76%），ATR（74%）和MYCL（73%）中观察到频繁突变。APC基因未包含在面板中。使用Cox比例风险模型的统计分析显示，低分化肿瘤与存活率之间存在不寻常的正相关（p = 0.025）。虽然没有发现特定突变或总突变率与总生存期之间存在显着的单变量关联，但我们对主要阿拉伯人群中CRC分子标记的初步分析可以提供对在潜在疾病进展中发挥重要作用的分子途径的见解。结论：当已经开发出针对患者突变谱的药物时，这些结果可能有助于优化个性化治疗。）
