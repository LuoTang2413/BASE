- Ovarian cancer is one of the most common cancers in women and the most concerning issues in gynecological oncology in recent years. It is postulated that many factors may contribute to the development of ovarian cancer, including hormonal imbalance. Estrogens are a group of hormones that have an important role both in physiological and pathological processes. In ovarian cancer, they may regulate proliferation, invasiveness and epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Estrogen signaling also takes part in the regulation of the biology of the tumor microenvironment. This review summarizes the information connected with estrogen receptors, estrogens and their association with a tumor microenvironment. Moreover, this review also includes information about the changes in estrogen receptor expression upon exposition to various environmental chemicals.
